# ToDo App

This is a ToDo app that I am creating in my free time to practice my skills and build my portfolio. It is currently in beta, with some planned features still in development. You can access the live demo of the app on Netlify: https://storied-daffodil-70ea21.netlify.app/

## Technologies Used

The app uses MERN stack with TypeScript for both server and client sides.

On the frontend, it features MUI components, Formik for the forms, and React-Query library for queries and state management (instead of Redux). The architecture is designed using services and const variables for better scalability and easy changes. The frontend is hosted on Netlify.

On the backend, the app features JWT authentication with Passwort library, the latest version of Mongoose, and MongoDB Atlas to store data. The architecture is designed with try-catch middleware and flexibility in mind. The backend is hosted on Render. **Please note that since I am using the basic free plan, queries and requests may be slow.**

## Planned Features

I am planning to add several features to the app in the near future, including filtering private and public todos (which is necessary for the app), adding email confirmation for signing up and logging in, and optimizing the entire app for better performance. 

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to contact me on my email kushkaoleg@gmail.com
